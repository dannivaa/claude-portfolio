## Context

GudFood Vdoma is a Ukrainian frozen food delivery service --- both D2C
brand and restaurant marketplace --- delivering to 26 cities across
Ukraine. I was brought in as a solo product designer to research why
users churned and redesign the experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem

Customers ordered once or twice and didn't return. The app had no
feedback system --- the team had zero structured data on why people
left. The UI felt dated compared to Glovo and Bolt Food.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research

7 user interviews with a mix of GudFood customers, competitors'
customers, and non-users. 4 provided the deepest insights.

### 4 Barriers to Reordering Identified

1.  **Delivery cost friction** --- 100--150₴ delivery on a single 200₴
    item feels disproportionate.
2.  **Offline alternatives win** --- Halya Baluvan is nearby, no
    planning, no waiting, no fee.
3.  **Trust gap** --- Users doubt frozen food reheated at home will
    match restaurant quality at similar price.
4.  **Shrinking assortment** --- Marketplace items decreasing; not all
    ship outside Kyiv.

### Critical Gap

No in-app feedback mechanism existed. One respondent complained via
Glovo and never received acknowledgment. The business had no structured
way to understand why customers churned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hypothesis

If we implement a structured feedback system (post-order ratings + dish
reviews + complaint resolution), retention will improve --- because the
business gains actionable data to fix quality issues, and users feel
heard, which increases trust and willingness to reorder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Solution

### Feedback System --- Core Feature

A closed loop with three touchpoints:

-   **Post-order rating**\
    Bottom sheet after delivery: star rating + quick-feedback tags +
    optional text. Under 10 seconds.

-   **Dish-level reviews**\
    User reviews on each product page build social proof and address the
    trust gap.

-   **Aggregated restaurant ratings**\
    Calculated from dish reviews, surfaces quality and pressures
    underperforming partners.

### Supporting Redesign

Full UI refresh across:

-   Homepage\
-   Product Detail\
-   Cart & Checkout\
-   Orders & Tracking\
-   Profile\
-   Support

Bringing the app in line with user expectations from Glovo and Bolt Food
while maintaining GudFood's warm brand identity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Outcome

Concept validated by the GudFood Vdoma product team as aligned with
their product roadmap. Not shipped into production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Learnings

### The absence of a feature is itself a finding

The biggest design opportunity was something nobody thought to build: a
feedback system.\
No feedback = no data, no accountability, no trust loop.

### Retention isn't solved by one feature --- it's an ecosystem

The feedback system only works in context: cleaner UI builds trust,
visible discounts create urgency, favorites reduce decision fatigue,
support closes complaint loops.

### Interview non-users, not just customers

Two of my most valuable respondents had never used GudFood.\
They revealed barriers that existing users had already normalized ---
the trust gap and dominance of offline alternatives.
